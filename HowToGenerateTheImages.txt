Setting this up
----------------------

These batch files expect to find, at the same level, all these things

1) A folder named "Art of Reading From DVD", with a sub-folder named "Images". Those should never be checked into the version control system.

ArtOfReading
    ArtOfReadingMultilingualIndex.txt
    installer.iss
    License.txt
    Pre-InstallInfo.txt
    |-- Art of Reading From DVD
        |-- Images

2) ImageMagick folder

ImageMagick (Convert): http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php
The batch file expect that you have unzip the entire folder from the portable version from here in the root of this directory: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows
and rename the folder "ImageMagick"

3) PNGOut.exe

PNGOut.exe is used to compress the daylights out of the png, so that they are in the end even smaller than the original tiffs

4) ExifTool.exe

ExifTool.exe : http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

5) The .iss file is the installer script for innosetup. THat can be just installed, no need to put it any place special.

-------------------------------------
what the batch file does
-------------------------------------

Copy the whole Art of Reading folder to a new name
For each tif
	Make a PNG out of it
	(and if the right command is uncommented): Stamp "SIL.AOR.CC-BY-ND" in the lower left
	Delete the tif
	Compress it really well
	Push in metadata

-------------------------------------
Warnings
-------------------------------------
This is fine, it's what this program always says:
	"convert: Unknown field with tag 37724 (0x935c) encountered. `TIFFReadDirectory' @ warning/...."

index.txt
----------------------
SIL GPS (Dallas) created the index... the guy who did it has since retired.  He could only give me one with the English and Indonesian combined.  He did it on a mac, hence the colons for directory separators, which I've preserved.
