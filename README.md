# ArtOfReading
Index and processing scripts related to the Art Of Reading illustration collection from SIL International.

AOR started out as a DVD named "International Illustrations: The Art of Reading". It contained over 10k b&w line drawings from SIL entities around the world.

The package came with a permissive license, but it was just in English prose. It came with a commercial catalogue viewer (I think Portfolio from Extensis), so it couldn't be given away (we had to pay for each copy).

In 2011, in consultation with the Global Publishing department of SIL (the copyright holder), Hatton did the following:

* added a Creative Commons License, embedded in each image
* embedded the index words into each image
* converted to PNG and compressed
* created a simple Windows installer
* published for free on the bloomlibrary.org site as "the Art of Reading"

In 2014, McConnel make a Linux package for AOR.

This repository does not contain the images themselves. It's just the various index files and scripts used to do the above.
